# Design a Data Structure SpecialStack that supports all the stack operations 
#   like push(), pop(), isEmpty(), isFull() and an additional operation getMin() 
#   which should return minimum element from the SpecialStack. 
# All these operations of SpecialStack must have a time and space complexity of O(1). 
#
# Note: To implement SpecialStack, you should only use standard Stack data structure 
#   and no other data structure like arrays, lists, etc
